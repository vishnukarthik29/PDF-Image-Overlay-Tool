## üìñ How to Use

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Click "Choose a PDF file" to upload your document
   - Click "Choose an image" to upload your signature/stamp/watermark

2. **Choose Layer Mode**:
   - **Overlay (on top)**: For signatures, stamps, or elements that should appear above content
   - **Background (behind)**: For watermarks, letterheads, or decorative backgrounds

3. **Configure Settings**:
   
   **For Overlay Mode**:
   - Select which pages to apply the image to
   - Choose horizontal position (Left/Center/Right)
   - Choose vertical position (Top/Middle/Bottom)
   - Adjust image size using the sliders
   - Fine-tune position with offset controls
   
   **For Background Mode**:
   - Select which pages to apply the background to
   - Image automatically fills the entire page

4. **Generate PDF**:
   - Click the "üé® Generate PDF" button
   - Wait for processing to complete
   - Click "‚¨áÔ∏è Download Signed PDF" to save your file

### Use Cases

#### Overlay Mode Examples
- Adding signatures to contracts
- Applying approval stamps to invoices
- Placing logos in specific positions
- Adding date/time stamps

#### Background Mode Examples
- Adding watermarks to all pages
- Creating branded letterheads
- Applying confidentiality backgrounds
- Adding decorative page backgrounds

## üí° Tips

- **Use PNG images** with transparent backgrounds for best overlay results
- **For backgrounds**: Semi-transparent PNGs work great as watermarks
- **Test with offsets**: Fine-tune your signature position perfectly in overlay mode
- **Preview mode**: Always check the image preview before processing
- **Page ranges**: Use format like "1,3,5" for specific pages or "1-3" for ranges
- **Background positioning**: Background mode ignores position settings and always fills the page

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for the user interface
- **PyPDF2**: PDF reading and manipulation
- **ReportLab**: PDF generation and image overlay creation
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Image processing and format conversion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "ModuleNotFoundError"
- **Solution**: Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue**: Image not appearing in PDF
- **Solution**: Check that your image file is not corrupted and try with a PNG file
- **Solution**: Verify the correct layer mode is selected (overlay vs background)

**Issue**: Invalid page range error
- **Solution**: Use correct format: "1,3,5" or "1-3" (page numbers start from 1)
- **Solution**: Ensure page numbers are within the document's page count

**Issue**: Background image not covering full page
- **Solution**: This should work automatically in background mode; if not, verify you selected "Background (behind)" mode

**Issue**: Image quality appears degraded
- **Solution**: Upload higher resolution images
- **Solution**: Adjust the width/height sliders in overlay mode for better sizing
